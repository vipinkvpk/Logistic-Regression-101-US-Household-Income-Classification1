# Logistic-Regression-101-US-Household-Income-Classification1
In this hands-on project, we will train Logistic regression and XG-Boost models to predict whether a particular person earns less than 50,000 US Dollars or more than 50,000 US Dollars annually. This data was obtained from U.S. Census database and consists of features like occupation, age, native country, capital gain, education, and work class.

The hands-on project on Logistic Regression101: US Income Classification is divided into the following tasks:  
Understand the problem statement and business case  Import libraries/datasets   
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis  Perform Data Visualization   
Prepare the data before model training  
Understand the intuition behind Logistic Regression   
Train and Evaluate a Logistic regression model  
Train and Evaluate a XG-Boost model
